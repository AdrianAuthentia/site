            <p>The information provided when using the Services is not intended for distribution to or use by any person
                or entity in any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or
                regulation or which would subject us to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or
                country. Accordingly, those persons who choose to access the Services from other locations do so on
                their own initiative and are solely responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent
                local laws are applicable.</p>
            <p><br /></p>
            <p>The Services are not tailored to comply with industry-specific regulations (Health Insurance Portability

                in a way that would violate the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA).</p>

            <p>These Legal Terms and any policies or operating rules posted by us on the Services or in respect to the
                Services constitute the entire agreement and understanding between you and us. Our failure to exercise
                or enforce any right or provision of these Legal Terms shall not operate as a waiver of such right or
                provision. These Legal Terms operate to the fullest extent permissible by law. We may assign any or all
                of our rights and obligations to others at any time. We shall not be responsible or liable for any loss,
                damage, delay, or failure to act caused by any cause beyond our reasonable control. If any provision or
                part of a provision of these Legal Terms is determined to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that
                provision or part of the provision is deemed severable from these Legal Terms and does not affect the
                validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. There is no joint venture, partnership,
                employment or agency relationship created between you and us as a result of these Legal Terms or use of
                the Services. You agree that these Legal Terms will not be construed against us by virtue of having
                drafted them. You hereby waive any and all defences you may have based on the electronic form of these
                Legal Terms and the lack of signing by the parties hereto to execute these Legal Terms.</p>
